# DriveSense-SQL-Pipeline

A lightweight telematics data platform for driving-behavior analytics, safety scoring, and downstream AI feature generation.

This project simulates a **Good Driver/telematics** style dataset with drivers, vehicles, trips, events, and claims.  
I used it to practice SQL for analytics, data quality checks, and feature engineering.
