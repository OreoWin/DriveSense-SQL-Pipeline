# DriveSense-SQL-Pipeline

A lightweight telematics data platform for driving-behavior analytics, safety scoring, and downstream AI feature generation.

---
This project simulates an automotive industry-style dataset with drivers, vehicles, trips, events, and claims. The primary goal is to practice SQL for analytics, data quality checks, and feature engineering. 

## Data

All CSV files are under `data/`:

- `drivers.csv` – demographics, state, risk segment, PII
- `vehicles.csv` – VIN, make/model, mapping to drivers
- `trips.csv` – timestamps, distance, night driving, harsh events
- `events.csv` – hard brakes, rapid acceleration, speeding, sharp turns
- `claims.csv` – claim type, amounts, shop info, approval status
- `repair_shops.csv` – partner vs non-partner shops across states

Database: **SQLite**, queries written and tested in **DBeaver**.

## Skills Highlighted 
- SQL (joins, windows, ETL, data checks)
